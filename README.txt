The website is a size comparison of many large animals extinct or alive. The website
consists of a graph with buttons to get a too scale png of the animal on the graph.
Mutiple animals can be on the graph as well. Also there if button is clicked some facts
will appears about that animals at the bottom.

HTML: grade A

I have used XHTML5 and I have added ID and scripts to make CSS and javascript to work with
the HTML. I also created the graph using HTML lines.

CSS: grade A

I have used CSS mainly are moment of positioning everything the colour and making everything
look better will come later. I have good understanding of how to use different types of
positioning and the use of margins.

JavaScript: B

I have written the functions in plain javascript by my self. The notable function getting to
data from the database via JSON. I have a good understanding of using manipulating HTML using
document.getElementByID. The buttons have event listeners for dynamism. The most javascript was
the placing and sizing the PNG since all the PNG had different resolution they wouldn't be to 
scale. So I have to find out the orginal size of PNG and then scale based on the length by 
changing the CSS in javascript. But I haven't used any classes.  

PNG : A

All the images in the graph will be PNG and were manipulated in gimp. I used layers the make the background 
transparent. Also changed the resolution and cropped so the length was just contained the animals. 


SVG : X

Server: C

At the moment I have only created a server with express.js and it runs and connects to the database.


Database: C

The database is SQLite and I have only created a table and inserted some data for instance the length of animal
and URL of the PNG. I have some ideas for callbacks and using WHERE and maybe an INNER JOIN. Like grouping 
all the reptiles and mammals together in a query.
